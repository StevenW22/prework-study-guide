# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation was to get an introduction into coding. This project was built to give me a small sample of what is to come during this course and after I transition into being a software engineer. It is very difficult to discribe everything that was touched on during the prework. What I can say is that I am eager to breakdown each step and master the craft one step at a time.

## Usage

JavaScript was the most challenging topic. I will without a doubt have to spend extra time outside of class to really grasp this topic. HTML, CSS, and Git all followed well into each other. I am excited to revisit those topics and dive into what separates them and have they flow off of each other.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
